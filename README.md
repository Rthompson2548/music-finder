- **Front-end**: The front-end of the application is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. React enables efficient rendering and provides a component-based architecture for easy development and maintenance. CSS is used for styling the application and ensuring an appealing visual experience.

- **Spotify API**: The application leverages the Spotify API to retrieve artist information, track data, and other related details. The API allows for seamless integration with Spotify's vast music catalog and features.

- **Node.js**: Node.js is utilized to handle the back-end functionality of the application. It facilitates server-side operations, including making requests to the Spotify API, handling data processing, and serving the application to clients.
